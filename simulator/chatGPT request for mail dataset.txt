I created 4 email addresses. For each of them I want to create a dataset of emails organised in 2 CSV files:

	1st file : Emails (UNIQUE_ID,SUBJECT,CONTENT)

	2nd file : Answers to those Emails (UNIQUE_ID, ANSWER_CONTENT)

Instructions:

	1) Files :

i) Each line i in both files has UNIQUE_ID = i and we have ANSWERS[i] is the answer to the email EMAILS[i]
ii) Each CONTENT and ANSWER must be exactly 300 characters long
iii) Each file contains 100 lines (so 100 emails or 100 answers).

	2) CONTENT and ANSWER_CONTENT :
