## End User Licence Agreement

# Smart Embedding Licence

## Whether it’s an iOS application, ePub or AndroidTV, or some other device: our Smart Embedding licence allows you to embed the fonts in any application (e.g. App, eBook or SmartWatch), as long as it’s part of the same project and will not exceed the limits of the licence.
## In addition to the Smart Embedding licence, we will give you one User Desktop Licence to test the fonts during the pre-coding design process.

The following is an agreement between you (the user/licencee) and the foundry TypeMates (licencer / TypeMates, J.Runge, N.Thomsen-Habermann, L.Fischbach GbR). If you do not accept these terms, you will not be able to purchase the font software licence and you may not use the fonts.

What you are purchasing from TypeMates is a licence to use our fonts (font software). You are purchasing the rights to use the fonts with respect to the following terms and conditions. You are not purchasing the copyright of the typeface.

Depending on the license, our fonts will be delivered in the following formats: OpenType (OTF), TrueType (TTF), as well as WebFont formats (EOT, WOFF, WOFF2). Additional formats are available on request, but may require an additional licence.

### With the purchase or installation of our fonts you agree to the following:

You may embed the fonts in an app, eBook or other software. It does not matter what kind of mobile platform or device is used; nor does it matter whether the app is made for iOS, Android or Windows phone, or the eBook a dynamic PDF, EPUB 2.01 or a KF8 format and make perpetual usage of the fonts.

You will be charged once, with the price based on the quantity of embed projects you require in total for your embedding products. The embed projects are not limited by geography, but all applications using the fonts must represent a single project.

The use of this font is limited to the number embed projects detailed on the invoice you received with the purchase of the font. If your work sells way better than expected and there are more projects to design with our font than detailed on the invoice, you will lose the right to continue to use the fonts until you update your license to include additional embed projects.

You may install the fonts on one computer to use and test it in your layouts and to make mockups of your application. If you want to use the font for other projects on your computer, you will need to purchase a proper Desktop+Web licence.

You must embed the fonts in a secure way, so that no one else may export or use the fonts.

You may make a back-up copy on a second computer. Registered users of www.typemates.com are, through their account, able to download fonts they have licenced at any time.

You may not convert the fonts to other font formats, nor may you modify, decompile or instruct a third party to convert, modify or decompile them.

This licence is not transferable. In the event that you do not want to use the font, you may not give your right to use or licence to a third party and you cannot sell, nor sub-licence the font licence or fonts.

You may not give the fonts to a person who does not own a licence for the font.

You may not embed the fonts into hardware (for example: the displays of washing machines, toasters, or devices like a GPS navigator or eReader). To do that, you will need a custom licence and should contact us.

If the yearly net profit of the licencee exceeds EUR 15 million the licencee is not allowed to use our fonts in their logo, in television broadcasts, cinema movies or in internet streams. Furthermore the licencee may not use our fonts for products that reproduce letter shapes like, for example, house numbers, stamps, craft templates or punched letters. Usage of this sort requires an enlarged and customised licence and, if you are in doubt, contact us for more information.

### Warranty and limitation of liability

TypeMates fonts can be returned or replaced only if they are defective. Defective fonts will be replaced if you have a valid proof of purchase and inform us about the error within 30 days of purchase. This warranty does not apply to font data that has been converted, manipulated or altered by you.
If not caused by gross negligence or malicious intent by us, TypeMates shall not be liable for any consequences, property or legal responsibility — including, but not limited to, lost profits and/or lost data — as a consequence of using our fonts.

### Termination

Any violation of this agreement by you, the licensee, will terminate this license. In case of termination, you are obligated to immediately remove all our fonts and all copies from your system and certify this to us, the licensor.

### Jurisdiction

This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. This Agreement shall not be subject to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.
The court of jurisdiction is in Passau, Germany.

### Miscellaneous

TypeMates reserves the right to modify this license at any time without notice. However, it will not restrict your previously purchased rights within the license.
Should a regulation of this contract be invalid in whole or part, the validity of other regulations shall remain unaffected.
